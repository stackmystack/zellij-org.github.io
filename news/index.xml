      <description>We just released Zellij 0.23.0, which adds collaboration features to our terminal multiplexer.
This solution allows multiple users to be attached to the same Zellij session and each have their own cursor. The cursors appear in different colors, giving a Google-docs like experience in the terminal and allowing users to be focused not only on different tabs, but on different panes in the same tab. That way they can see each other type in real time.</description>
