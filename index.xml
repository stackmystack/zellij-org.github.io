      <description>We just released Zellij 0.23.0, which adds collaboration features to our terminal multiplexer.
This solution allows multiple users to be attached to the same Zellij session and each have their own cursor. The cursors appear in different colors, giving a Google-docs like experience in the terminal and allowing users to be focused not only on different tabs, but on different panes in the same tab. That way they can see each other type in real time.</description>

      <description>Zellij is a terminal workspace. It has the base functionality of a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux or screen) but includes many built-in features that would allow users to extend it and create their own personalized environment.

 Layout Engine Zellij includes a layout engine, allowing users to define a map of panes in a yaml file and load it when they start the app.</description>
